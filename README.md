# A very simple Jekyll theme based on AACInfo

So you want to create a ACE Centre minisite?

You have two options.

## 1. The easy route

* Fork this project. (Login and click on fork project above). More info [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#fork-an-example-repository)
* Update your files at the root of this project with something.md in them
* Use forestry.io

##2. The better - but not always *best* route

* Create a new Jekyll site and in your _config.yml file put:

`theme: aacinfo-theme`

* Then install the gem

`gem install aacinfo-theme`

Happy days!
